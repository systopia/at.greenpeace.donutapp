## Usage

To use the DonutApp API, you need `client_id` and `client_secret`, which will
be provided by Formunauts.

To import petitions, use the `DonutPetition.import` API call.

To import donations, use the `DonutDonation.import` API call.

Campaigns used when creating entities can be specified through various means
and are used in this precedence:

* Via an optional/custom `external_campaign_id` field within the DonutApp
  API response
* Via the `donutapp_campaign_map` setting, which maps DonutApp campaigns
  to CiviCRM campaigns. The mapping is stored as an array in the form of
  `['{donutapp_campaign_id}' => '{civicrm_campaign_id}']`.
* Via the `campaign_id` parameter passed to the `import` API

## Known Issues

* Only recurring donations are supported
